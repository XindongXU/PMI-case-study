48,4.0,Top Shine Cherub Disposable Vape 5% Nicotine,I like the flavor taste and sweetness. The problem with top shine is the long lasting part.

71,5.0,"Great, consistent flavor","Really enjoy most flavors. The ice are ""cooler"" than the others. They last longer than most. Since this brand isn't available in AZ, Huff & Puffers is my go to for best variety and price!",4.0,5.0,5.0
72,5.0,Peach ice,Really a great vape. Flavor is amazing. Just wish I didn't have to order by mail,5.0,5.0,4.0
73,5.0,Still a favorite,"We keep coming back to the Top Shine Cherub even after trying others. The flavor is rich and smooth, without having a chemical or metallic after-taste. It was recommended to us to only charge these pens for 10-20 minutes at a time because if they are allowed to fully charge, the flavor ends up with a burnt taste due to the intensity of the vaporizer.",5.0,5.0,5.0

97,4.0,Flavor stays but burned out quicker than others,Solid,,,
98,5.0,it's OK,it's OK,,,
99,5.0,Surprisingly good,"I'm reluctant to try new brands these days as I've gotten so many duds that way. I passed over this brand for some time but I'm pleasantly surprised by Top Shine. I purchased the Lychee flavored vape and I will definitely try it again. This vape has a smooth texture, very bold flavor, even for lychee which is often subtle. It tastes juicy and more like the real fruit, not artificial or candy like, and no after taste. No real complaints here.",,,
100,4.0,Tastes good but the taste will fade very quickly,I like this product but I think the taste fades very quickly.,,,
101,5.0,Banana ice,Probably one of the best banana ice I‚Äôve had,,,
102,5.0,Peach ice,I love the peach ice. It has the best flavor and it lasts me about two weeks. It‚Äôs the best brand I‚Äôve tried so far,,,
103,5.0,Chubby Cherub‚Ä¶.,This is the first vape I ever tried and I have loved them ever since. An amazing product.,,,

105,5.0,Strawberry Watermelon,This Vape is very good comparing to all the ones I have bought. Long lasting taste and it last very very long. A+++++++++++,,,
106,5.0,Flavorful,"This is my girlfriend's favorite brand and I can see why. The flavors are rich and are not as basic as the other disposables. You can tell the company invests a lot of research into getting the flavors right. There hasn't been a flavor that I didn't like! They last long and are rechargeable with USB-C. They die an awful death though, meaning the burnt flavor comes out of nowhere when they are about to die. Will probably order more once we are done trying everything else :)",,,
107,5.0,Smooth vape,"If you love menthol, this is the one!",,,
108,5.0,One of the best Disposables,"These are one of the best disposables! Good flavor, no spit back, and lasts a long time (over a week). Key is not to charge the battery all the way so the coil doesn't burn. Down sides are the USB-C connector for charging and the blue light can be too bright at night.",,,

116,5.0,Really good,Pulls easy and a very nice grape flavor,,,
117,5.0,"Probably My Favorite, Blueberry-Lemon","Have tried a few disposables now and have to say, this one lasts a really long time and I love the flavor. Can taste both the blueberry and the lemon. Has a good draw; I do not care for ones that make huge puffs of vapor. This one is perfect, at least for me anyway! Will purchase this brand again for sure!",,,
