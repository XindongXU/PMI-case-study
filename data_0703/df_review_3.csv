Although I love some of their flavors Ive started to purchase this brand a bit less because they seem to burn more easily than other brands, and they run out of flavor fairly quickly. So far I've only managed to make it to the end of one of these, which is kind of a shame. But their Sakura Grape flavor will always be the GOAT. I also love strawberry pina colada, pinapple coconut ice, and watermelon canteloupe honeydew. Tropical rainbow and strawberry banana are very good too. Watermelon candy, strawberry mango, and peach mango are decent. I didnt care for lemon mint or red mojito. The only flavors I thought were gross were rainbow cloudz, gumi, and white gummy.",,,
