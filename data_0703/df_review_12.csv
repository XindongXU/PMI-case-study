196,5.0,2nd runner up for new fav vape,I‚Äôve been trying to experiment to find great new vapes and the ohmlet is an upgrade to the regular daze egg vape. Good flavors not dissatisfied. Love the pineapple whip flavor. I would buy again. Good hit flow and quality flavor. Last a good length of time too.,,,
197,5.0,Good!,Very good flavors!,,,
198,5.0,Last forever,"I really like the daze vape juice so I decided to try this. Let me tell you that this disposable doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It has great flavor and it‚Äôs rechargeable. It took me a min to get used to big salt, but now I love it.",,,
199,4.0,Great flavors!,These have great flavors. Gave only one star less than 5 because the draw action is kinda weird sometimes. Aside from that I have no complaints.,,,

201,5.0,Favorite vape,I love all of the Daze vapes!,,,
202,4.0,A little too sweet for me.,Kind of too sweet for me but last longer because 7000 puffs.,,,
203,5.0,The best,longest and best yet,,,
204,5.0,Long Lasting,"I purchased several Daze Ohmlet devices because they claim to last up to 7000 puffs. Of course, I haven't tested the accuracy of this claim, but they certainly last longer than any other disposable vapes I've tried. The flavors are decent as well. Not too bland, not too many different flavors packed into one, but just the right amount of basic sweetness. They are rechargeable with USB-C to make them even longer lasting. Would recommend this to anyone who find their disposables run out too fast.",,,
205,5.0,üëçüëç,Love it,,,

237,3.0,Just ok,Not a huge fan. Coming from the Elf Bar; the flavor is not as strong and the draw is sub-par on these. Great for a backup but definitely will be going back to the Elf Bar.,,,
238,5.0,My favorite rechargeable,"Loving the Daze rechargeables! Super long lasting and great flavors. I got the Pineapple Peach Whip and Icy Blast. I'm not big on fruity flavors but it had me wanting to try more. I usually stick to mint/menthol flavors, and Icy Blast is definitely in my personally top 3. A perfect balance of ice and sweet.",,,
