106,5.0,Best I've used,I like my flavors to skew towards real flavors versus candied flavors and these Lucids are the best so far. I find the iciness to be just right on most flavors.

124,3.0,Lucid air disposable vape,It didn't seem to last as long as it should have but I really liked it,,,
125,5.0,One of the Ten Best Flavours Currently on the Market,"This actually tastes like chocolate! True, three menthe gives it a chocolate mint sensation. But it's incredibly smooth & pleasantly sweet, but more on the savory side of sweet, more like a dessert than a candy. As far as quality: the phrase on the box hasn't been wrong so far, the flavour has remained strong, refreshing, and chocolate-ey until the (un-re-chageable) battery dies. Which, for me, takes about three weeks (I have several pens going at once). This is one of the ones I can count on to taste good everytime I go to it. Never gets that salty in the back of your mouth taste. Love it!!!",,,
126,5.0,Long lasting,Great flavor lasted almost 3 weeks for me and flavor was strong whole time,,,
127,2.0,Lucid Air Mint,Not the best quality.,,,
128,5.0,Choco Milk,"I'm obsessed. This one smells and tastes delicious, like, legitimately chocolatey! This is my second time around and I'm super pleased. I only wish this were rechargeable. I tried Krispie Treats too, which was not bad but tasted nothing like Rice Krispies, it actually was more... citrusy? Like gummi bears. Very bizarre. These last a good while too, even with me reaching for it constantly.",,,
129,5.0,Good,Enjoyable and easy,,,
130,5.0,Great Flavor,This one had great flavor and lasted me almost 4 days. Great for the price.,,,
131,4.0,Good quality but mint can be hard,"Their mint flavor can be a lot, especially when you first open it. It almost gives you a brain freeze if you hit it too hard",,,
132,5.0,Aloe grape ice is my go to pick,I have purchased hundreds of vapes ..well I have settled on lucid air aloe grape ice. I've tried every flavor of lucid air if you enjoy a sweet vape this one hits the spot. Flavor lasts till the last draw. I will and do recommend this to all of my vape friends.,,,
133,5.0,Amazing product,"I vape daily in place of cigarettes, I tried several other brands and the flavor would die out after a few days. Lucid air has been my favorite since I‚Äôve came across it. The flavor last until the battery dies out and this vape last for a significant amount of time.",,,

137,5.0,#1 Choice,"This brand and style is my absolute favorite. Max hits, best flavors and a smooth filtered draw. Rainbow sherbet is my go to with raspberry lemonade a close second.",,,
138,3.0,Honeydew ice,"Wasn‚Äôt a fan of this (very different draw/strength than my go-to elfbar). It‚Äôs really light, and more ice than honeydew. May be a good option for someone who wants a mild flavor.",,,

153,5.0,ICEYYYY,Lucids have been my go to ever since I tried it for the first time. The menthol is perfect. I used to smoke camel silvers and these most definitely provide almost the same amount but at the same time not losing its flavor. Blue raspberry lemonade..

289,5.0,Lucid air vape,"I like this vape alot and I've tried many. I find that having 5000 puffs ensures that I can reorder when I start the last vape and have the new order by the time I need it. The vape is nicely shaped, comes in great colors, has a comfortable mouth piece , draws well and has good flavors when they are available. My only negative comment is that it isn't rechargeable . Nonetheless, the good points outweigh the negative.",,,

305,5.0,Lucid grapefruit,"Taste is just on point. Smooth. Lasts for a while. Depending how u smoke, the battery might die way before the flavour starts to fade away. Which is a shame to feel like wasting such good smoke like that. I wish it was rechargeable.",,,

- Very thick cloud vape, fruity menthol flavor type

- Battery dies out pretty fast if you frequently hit it back to back

321,3.0,Disposable,"Flavor it‚Äôs tasty but the battery isn‚Äôt that great it doesn‚Äôt give you 5000 puffs
It‚Äôs more like half of it",,,
322,4.0,Definitely good,The honeydew and aloe grape are my top flavors. The menthol is not too over powering. The only reason I gave them 4/5 stars is because I feel their quality check is lacking a bit. Meaning some times the airflow feels more restricted then the previous same disposable. Or that it stops working even though there is still some juice left (fyi just hit the pen in a different position.. kinda annoying but a easy fix). But even with the issues it is not enough for me to stop buying them consistently.,,,
323,5.0,Great,Great,,,
324,4.0,Flavor lasts!,"Great disposable. Will probably purchase again. Rainbow Sherbet should be called Rainbow Sherbet ICE. Not liking this trend of manufactures adding mint to flavors without disclosing it. Gummy flavor from another brand tasted minty as welll..yea rainbow sherbet is technically a frozen treat, so I kinda get that, but WTH gummy?. :shrugs: -1 star.",,,
325,5.0,Can‚Äôt go wrong,If you like smooth menthol. This taste is like no other.,,,
326,5.0,Lucid Air,Great last a long time,,,
