23,5.0,"Accurate taste, Goes on forever","This brand has very accurate flavor taste! No weird chemical taste or funky fake taste. everyone Iâ€™ve let puff in the strawberry, fall in love with it. additionally this vape lasts longer than any vape Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™ve had about 6 of the top brands so far and their one keeps going. Itâ€™s comfortable to draw and the charge lasts well.
love the customer service of huff puffers these guys are truly outstanding, very accommodating and not greedy. I live a place that does not nickeled and dime you! Finally their rewards program is legit. Itâ€™s not like those that hey you nowhere; their program actually makes my vapes cheaper. I I was not given anything to write this. Iâ€™m just a customer thatâ€™s totally impressed with how this place is run and I love NUNU Box. Thanks guys! Sabrina",5.0,5.0,5.0

31,5.0,Weird and awesome,I picked one of these up on the look of it alone and I was surprised at how much I ended up loving this vape. It's a small little box and you feel that when you're holding it but it's oddly satisfying. Great air flow and flavor to top it off. I tried the blue fizz or blue energy something. Loved it.,,,
