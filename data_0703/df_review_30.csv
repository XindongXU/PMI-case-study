7,5.0,The Best,"I have been trying to find a vape that meets my needs after years of smoking menthols. I came across this on vacation in California and new it was the one! I live in Las Vegas and really hate the extra cost to ship it here, but I have not found anything that compares.",,,
8,1.0,Worst vape ever.,"Another one I had high hopes for but it was the worst one I've ever tried 0/10. It's bulky, ugly, very tight air flow that makes the hit incredibly harsh and unpleasant. Also the vapor feels hot when inhaled which was a weird feeling. Also, been looking for a good fruit punch flavor, this fruit punch was like sweet burning harsh chemical taste.",,,

11,5.0,Definitely a favorite,Blood Orange Mango Ice is probably one of my favorite flavors.. may not last as long as some of the other brands but the flavor will keep me buying.. I almost forget about the boost at the bottom but it‚Äôs nice when I do remember!,,,
