133,2.0,Gigantic and overly artificial,"Odd flavors - they do grow on you though - and extremely strange shaped. They're like 2x the size of Elf bars (who makes them) and weirdly ripply? I assume they're trying to be sci fi which was the main draw for me, but they fell short.",3.0,4.0,3.0

145,4.0,Mesh coil is a welcome edition to the ELFBAR brand,"Huff & Puffers can always be counted on to offer a wide selection of current, legitimate vape products. It‚Äôs the only shop in SoCal I‚Äôve seen that carries Lost Marys. I love the battery life indicator, something missing from the BC5000. The only off-putting part is when the device is toward the end of its life, you get an absolutely foul tasting last hit with almost no warning. That kind of taste sticks with you for a while, haha. But nothing beats the convenience and variety offered by disposables.",5.0,3.0,4.0
146,5.0,Yummmm,"The Lost Mary Elf Bars are super sweet. Pairs really nicely with my preworkout supplements (ghost, sour patch kids, red berry). My favorite so far from this vape would be Watermelon or Strawberry Pineapple.",5.0,5.0,5.0
