28,5.0,"Rechargeable Vape, Great Flavor",I love the flavors and that it is rechargeable. So many disposable vapes I have bought run out of battery before the flavor does. This vape allows you to recharge it. I also like the adjustable airflow it comes with. The price is great too. It is a long lasting vape. The design could use some work but it's small enough to fit in my hand and pockets.,,,
