20,5.0,flavour on point,but does not last long,,,
21,5.0,The reason I stopped smoking!,"I have been a smoker for 20+ years. I have tried many different vape types and flavors over the years, but never cared for any of them. Earlier this year, my son brought home one of the Opus Ice Mint vapes. I was hooked.
It didn‚Äôt happen overnight, but my cigarette smoking started decreasing until I have now kicked the habit for good.
I only like the Ice Mint flavor. I have tried the other Opus flavors and have not cared for them. I‚Äôm sure it is because I was a menthol smoker.
Anyways, long story short, I am thankful for these.",,,

51,3.0,Sometimes good sometimes bad,I love the flavor profile of these vapes it‚Äôs probably one of my favorite disposables. When it works well it lasts about 3 days for me. However sometimes when I get a bad battery it dies within 3-5 hours right after I open a fresh box. Kills the mood whenever that happens especially at a music festival or rave.,,,
