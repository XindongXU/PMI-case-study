17,5.0,Very nice,"I usually don't like disposables, however I was in a pinch due to not being able to find the coils I use for my mod ANYWHERE, and I needed something to get me through. The flavor is fantastic and stays consistent to the very end, where some start getting weird. Does it have the advertised puffs? No idea. Maybe. If not, it's definitely closer than some of the competitors claims. Would definitely buy again. My adult children go through more well known brand disposables left and right and they were also very impressed!",5.0,5.0,5.0

32,5.0,"Great flavor, lasting, short battery","The flavors are great, tried a few and liked them all. Lemon-Mint, Cola Fizz, and Matcha Frappe are excellent. The juice does last a long time, (more than the cherubs) but the battery needs recharging more frequently, that's the only downside. I say try em! These are my go-to.",5.0,5.0,5.0
