70,4.0,Blue Raz üíô,Always good. Lasts longer than most. Sweet but not cloying. Solid disposable.,4.0,4.0,4.0
71,4.0,Rechargeable Pod üëçüèº,Definitely solves my complaint with the original Pod Mesh Flo; the rechargeability is super helpful so you don‚Äôt get to that low flo-to-burnout place. I will say the Frozen Blue Raz flavor is slightly different from the Frozen Blue Raz of the other (non rechargeable) Pod Mesh Flo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a tad sweeter; but not in a bad way. Overall decent disposable that I‚Äôve returned to many a time!,4.0,4.0,5.0

78,5.0,Best disposable I have tried,"This brand/model is the best type of disposable i have tried out of probably a dozen or more. The flavors are good (not too chemmy-tasting), the unit lasts a long time, is rechargeable, and airflow is adjustable. The best flavor I have tried is peach, followed by banana, then grape/aloe. All of them are good compared to other brands.",5.0,3.0,5.0
79,5.0,üëç,Great punch,3.0,3.0,5.0
80,3.0,Just okay,A little harsh. My favorite part about it is the absence of thay menthol taste all of the other flavors have. I use this one with coffee in the mornings.,3.0,3.0,4.0

94,3.0,Long lasting,I appreciate the longevity but not a fan of the hit on this device. Flavors are good though,,,
95,3.0,Cookies & Cream,"It's okay, I don't love it, I don't hate it. Flavour is mild, and it doesn't taste like cookies and cream. My boyfriend said it tastes like graham crackers, which is pretty accurate. I would say it's reminiscent of cinnamon graham crackers specifically. If that's your thing, go for it! I was originally turned off by this brand when I tried their marshmallow flavour (my friend loved it, it just tasted like chemicals to me). Even though this one isn't my fave, it's decent, so I would try another flavour for sure.",,,

111,4.0,Long life and tasty,I‚Äôm not one for the creamy/cookies/custard flavors but this one was actually pretty good. It reminded me more like coco puffs than it did cookies and cream. I combined this with the candy king mint fresh and together it tasted like a thin mint! Would try this brand again but perhaps a different flavor next time.,,,

167,5.0,Awesome All-Around Vape,"PROS:
- Very thick cloud vape, fruity menthol flavor type
- Rechargeable (MicroUSB)
- Never dries out my throat
- Satisfying hit if you take a big hit to supress the cigarette urges
- Can change to 3 different flow levels....Low/Medium/High flow
CONS:
- Battery dies out pretty fast if you frequently hit it back to back
- Very square shape vape, doesnt bother me but might be too big for others who prefer a smaller vape
- Not Type-C
- Sometimes makes me cough, (My throat is a little sensitive tho)",,,
