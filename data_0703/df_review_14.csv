116,5.0,Hi,Love these guys. They don't cost your mouth like some of the others.,4.0,5.0,4.0
117,5.0,The best flavored vapes,"I used to smoke menthol cigs back in the day and switched to normal tobacco cigs. Since weening off cigarettes and whiting to vapes, I don‚Äôt want to be reminded of menthol / tobacco flavors anymore. I‚Äôve noticed with almost all disposables, they have a minty flavor. These do not. I‚Äôm in love. I‚Äôll be purchasing other flavors soon. Honeydew Ice and lychee berry are my faves so far.",5.0,5.0,5.0
118,3.0,Okay (not bad) Vape Brand,"I like this brand, but I personally didn‚Äôt like the strawberry lush taste over their other flavors.",2.0,3.0,4.0
119,5.0,üëçüëç,"SWFT is one of my favorite brands. I usually get rechargeable disposables. I've tried most of them and SWFT is on my top five. Also, Huff and Puffers is my go to supplier as of the March 2022. Glad I found them.",,,
120,5.0,Swft Mod Cool Mint,Smooth and refreshing minty hit,,,
121,5.0,So cute and colorful,These disposables are so perfect in size and so colorful. I love how they look and I got 4 of them to see how they all taste and I think the grape ice is the best so far. I also love how this company doesn‚Äôt use random shipping couriers like all the other vape stores do. I got my package in a weeks time so that beats the month time frame from all the other vape stores!,,,
122,4.0,Good value,The flavors are great. Seems to last quite a long time and they are reasonably priced on this site. Would have given 5 stars but swft needs to improve QC every so often you get a defective unit. Huff and Puffers has great customer service and is awesome about taking care of any problems promptly.,,,
123,4.0,Best flavors but die quickly,"MY FAVE!!! Pods and elf bars are way too sweet for me so when I tried this brand all the flavors so far have been great. If you‚Äôre looking for something not too sweet then this is the brand for you. The only downside is after a week the flavor dies down and it tastes like sugar vapor, like no flavor just a sweet inhale. So that gets so annoying. My go to is the pink lemonade and honey dew. Pineapple punch is good also. I just picked up gummy bear and it‚Äôs ok. I can‚Äôt really pinpoint what it reminds me of but it‚Äôs probably my least fave so far.",,,
124,5.0,Good vape,Good vape good flavor,,,
125,1.0,NOooo,WAY to much mint‚Ä¶. Not for me. I can‚Äôt even use it,,,
126,2.0,Poor flavor,The flavor of this one was weird and tasted like bathroom cleaner.,,,

136,4.0,I would recommend it,flavours depend on your choice . But still its an above average vape,,,
137,5.0,Pink slush,The pink slush is definitely one of my top favorites,,,
138,5.0,lychee & honeydewww,"been getting SWVT for a while now and I‚Äôd def recommend this to anyone who wants a long lasting flavor to the end, i‚Äôve charged each one only twice and it goes a long way! Lychee & Honeydew are my favs!",,,
139,4.0,Decent,"I've only tried the pineapple one. The flavor was mediocre. Didn't really stand out among the other ones. I personally like the design, but I wouldn't get out of my way to look for these. If they were the only ones a vape shop had, I wouldn't mind buying it though.

145,5.0,Yes!,My favorite vape. Not too strong and not too light.,,,
146,5.0,One of the best disposables I‚Äôve had,This is one of the best disposables I‚Äôve tried. Flavors are there and the best part is that it‚Äôs rechargeable. One of my previous fave was the lucid air but it wasn‚Äôt rechargeable so it was a waste. I went to a vape shop and was recommended this one and now it‚Äôs my fave! Highly recommended!,,,

154,5.0,Another great vape from SWFT,"Tried out the Strawberry Lush Ice flavor this time and so far it's pretty good! I think I still like the Lush Ice better, but this one is nice as well. Can't wait to try out other flavors from SWFT.",,,
155,5.0,One of my favorite vapes,"I've really been enjoying the SWFT Mods so far! They hit pretty hard and they're nicely mentholated. Also last a surprisingly long time! This is my first time trying them and I really like the Lush Ice flavor so far. The only downside is they require a microUSB cord to charge so I had to dig one out of storage, but otherwise a great vape!",,,
156,4.0,Lychee Peach,"It hit very nice, wasn‚Äôt as sweet as I liked but overall a solid flavor and battery",,,
157,5.0,9/10,Flavor tasted exactly how I‚Äôd imagine it to be and it gave out strong nicotine hits. The vape itself lasted for a while about a month until it started to taste burnt.,,,
158,5.0,Loved it,Apple was amazing flavor,,,
159,3.0,Grape,"This brand was ok. The flavor was ok too. It hit hard, in my opinion. Not a full flavor hit, but kind of harsh. It would make me cough every now and then.",,,
160,2.0,I had high hopes,"This vape has a few things good going for it. 1. The air flow. It doesn‚Äôt have AFC but the AF is perfect IMO. 2. Love the way it feels and looks. 3. Rechargeable. The flavor was muted, then non existent after 50-100 puffs. Not my favorite.",,,

168,5.0,Great mod,"My friends and I love to try all these different disposable mods
Swift so far on each flavor has been a home run",,,
169,4.0,It‚Äôs good,Flavor is the the kinda fake strawberry that taste more like real strawberry. For those who fancy the vapes in the strawberries spectrum y‚Äôall will know what I mean.,,,
