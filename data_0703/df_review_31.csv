22,5.0,Love these,"The flavors are yummy, the vape hits smoothly, and you don't have to charge them. I will definitely be buying more of these.

28,5.0,it lasts a long time,"Although it is not rechargeable, the charge lasts until the liquid runs out.",,,
29,5.0,Nice 5,This one is my favorite one.,,,
30,5.0,Awesome Vape and Flavor,It’s flavor is outstanding I like the hard case it comes with . The only drawback i saw was it didn’t last as long as the Elfbar but it’s still my all time favorite and would buy again.,,,
31,5.0,EDM Nic5 has been my new favorite vape !!,"I bought one in august to try it out for the first time. September I bought 3 flavors. So far the mangoe aloe is my favorite flavor, melon lemon is also good. Blue passion is a bit strong, but still great flavor quality. Malibu lime is very tangy and definitely not similar to Lime Romance Flum. I love the entire quality of the EDM. Hits great, last a very long time.",,,
32,5.0,Mesh Coil goodness,"I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to vapes, especially disposables, but it claims to have a mesh coil and I think that makes this vape hit differently. It has a much more satisfying drag and feels much stronger than the other disposables I've tried. I think the coil makes them taste better as well. The design and colors are nice. The only downside is that they are not rechargeable.",,,
33,3.0,Edm,It’s good if you like it sweet!,,,
34,5.0,La Mousse,"I was surprised at the flavour. I know, I know, it's green, but I don't know much French. I expected it to taste like... chocolate mousse honestly, since that's what comes to mind when I hear mousse. What it actually tastes like sounds more like what people describe Cactus OG as - La Mousse is citrusy for sure, possibly tangy, definitely sweet. I think it might be pineapple? Either way it's really good. Though it didn't last as long for me, I'd still buy it again. I'm very curious about the Dragon blackcurrant, so might try that next.",,,
35,5.0,Top Shelf Flavors,It hold its taste all the way tell the finish. Great battery life.,,,
36,2.0,Mint Flavor,This one vaped a bit too sweet for me.,,,
37,5.0,Nic5,Cactus OG. If you haven’t even tried it. Do it. I’ve always looked for that good citrusy or tangy flavor.. this one delivers! Seriously tastes like cactus cooler. lasts for a great amount of time,,,
38,5.0,Great device and flavor!,The salesperson at the store recommended it and she was spot on!! Thanks Huff and Puffers!!,,,
39,5.0,Was recommended this by a worker,Overall really good. No charging port for this but flavor seemed to last til the end,,,
40,3.0,Ok,"Flavor ok, battery life standard. Ran out faster than most in this puff and price range. Not rechargeable . Just an average device. Not bad but not the best.",,,
