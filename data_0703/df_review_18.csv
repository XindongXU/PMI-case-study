85,3.0,Good but not great.,"I had very high hopes for these because they look just like my favorite, Vibez. I was expecting them to be sweeter and more flavorful but they all let me down in a way. The sour blue straws are good but didn't love the others.",,,

112,4.0,fruit gush,Good,,,
113,5.0,Candy king,"Its good, would definitely recommend this to everyone",,,
114,3.0,"Great Flavor, Short Life.",Not sure if it the disposable I got but this vape didn‚Äôt last as long as I thought. I got the mint fresh flavor and it tasted great but the life didn‚Äôt last that long even after charging it the vape didn‚Äôt have much in kick in it. Would recommend trying the puff plus or the flume for a mint vape,,,
115,5.0,Good or great?,This disposable vape has great flavor but if I compare it to other Vapes it's hard to draw on so I would say this vape is good not great.,,,
116,2.0,Kinda weak,"It‚Äôs good at first but the puffs get weak after some use, even after recharging it",,,

120,5.0,Solid,Good brand good flavors. This one is pretty good,,,
121,5.0,Candy King,Saw it was new and tried it. Hits decently,,,
122,4.0,Pretty bomb,"I like the shape and feel of it, a lot of other disposables are thick and a little bulky and this fits in my pocket really well. Flavor isn't amazing but better than a lot of others out there. Would probably buy again to try the other flavors",,,
123,4.0,It‚Äôs good,"Flavor is not mind blowing. Pretty standard artificial strawberry flavor (but sent they all?). the thin form factor and rechargeable aspect is what really sells this one. Also the draw is pretty tight on these, might be good or bad depending on you.",,,
124,5.0,Candy king,Good flavor,,,
125,5.0,Love it,Great flavor and lasts a long time. Not much cloud but over all it‚Äôs great. Have purchased more and when they get more in stock I will buy again.,,,
126,4.0,Flavor is kind of weak,"Only reason I gave a 4 because it lasted awhile, but the flavor was really light and you have to hit hard on it just to get something out of it.",,,
127,4.0,Strawberry Roll,It‚Äôs good.,,,
