136,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Five star for the vibez,"Vibez are the best disposables I have come across and I've been vaping over ten years. You just have to be careful with the flavor you get. All of them taste just how the flavor says but with a few flavors after you charge it the flavor changes. It's not bad it's just not the same anymore. I can say that once I tasted vibez it was a done deal. I haven't used any other brand since.
