115,3.0,8 months,5 months to 1 year ago,"Great Flavor, Short Life.",Not sure if it the disposable I got but this vape didn‚Äôt last as long as I thought. I got the mint fresh flavor and it tasted great but the life didn‚Äôt last that long even after charging it the vape didn‚Äôt have much in kick in it. Would recommend trying the puff plus or the flume for a mint vape,,,
116,5.0,8 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Good or great?,This disposable vape has great flavor but if I compare it to other Vapes it's hard to draw on so I would say this vape is good not great.,,,

123,4.0,10 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Pretty bomb,"I like the shape and feel of it, a lot of other disposables are thick and a little bulky and this fits in my pocket really well. Flavor isn't amazing but better than a lot of others out there. Would probably buy again to try the other flavors",,,
124,4.0,10 months,5 months to 1 year ago,It‚Äôs good,"Flavor is not mind blowing. Pretty standard artificial strawberry flavor (but sent they all?). the thin form factor and rechargeable aspect is what really sells this one.
