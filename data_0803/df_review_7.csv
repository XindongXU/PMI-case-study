6,3.0,6 days,Less than 2 months,"Love Flum, Love Flavor, The Gio - Not So Much","Would religiously vape on the Flum Gio. You are supposed to get 3,000 hits out of the Gio, but it always seemed like less. I also had multiple occasions where it would die after a day or two when it should have been lasting an average of 5-7 days. Huff and Puffers being as great as they are, provided me with a partial refund for the inconvenience. I didn't want to keep having the same issue, so I did some research.
Then I found the Pebble which gave you an average of double the hits for $1.00 more. Instead of stocking up 5 vapes for an average of 2 to 3 weeks, I can buy 7 for $1.00 more for 1.5 to 2 months. Definitely a no brainer! Wish they made a Powerbull flavor in the Pebble!",5.0,2.0,1.0

- Very Similar to Lucid Air Vape

CONS:
- Not rechargeable
