21,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,The reason I stopped smoking!,"I have been a smoker for 20+ years. I have tried many different vape types and flavors over the years, but never cared for any of them. Earlier this year, my son brought home one of the Opus Ice Mint vapes. I was hooked.
It didn‚Äôt happen overnight, but my cigarette smoking started decreasing until I have now kicked the habit for good.
I only like the Ice Mint flavor. I have tried the other Opus flavors and have not cared for them. I‚Äôm sure it is because I was a menthol smoker.
Anyways, long story short, I am thankful for these.",,,
