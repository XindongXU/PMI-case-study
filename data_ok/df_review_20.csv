49,1.0,4 months,3 months to 5 months ago,🤮 Not a fan. Weird flavor.,"Wanted to like this…hey, you win some you lose some. I always try Blue Raz Ice flavors first, and this was just disappointing straight out the gate. Literally took maybe 5-6 hits total and had to pitch it I hated it so much. Flavor was just weird/unbalanced, didn’t taste right. Thought maybe it was just me or that it was new so went back to it a few times and every time made a yuck face so, its a no from me. Maybe other flavors are good but I won’t spend the $ to try bc I was so disappointed. Bummer!",1.0,3.0,3.0

90,4.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Vietnamese Coffee,"This is the second time I've ordered this, and - as ridiculous as this will sound - I'm still not sure I like it. I love coffee flavours and haven't seen many on Huff & Puffers, so I had to get this. It is strong brewed coffee, little to no milk, and not sweet. It's nice when you are drinking very sweet coffee to vape this. Or, I'll alternate this with a chocolate vape so there's still that hint of chocolate there. Vaping it in between eating chocolate is very good too. Also, for me at least, it's good, mellow, before bed vape, instead of perky citrus or very sweet vapes.",,,

94,2.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,It’s no Elf…,"I’m not sure if it was just the flavor (aloe berry) or the brand, but it tasted awful, like how I imagine febreze might taste. I thought it might be similar to an elfbar because of the design, but it wasn’t. Again, it could just be the flavor, but I do typically like the aloe flavors by other brands.",,,
95,1.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Fog X Box Frozen Mint,"I love trying different vapes. I usually do pretty well. This one though, was definitely not a favorite of mine. It lacked the minty flavor. It was harsh. I've had this one for about 3 wks now, because it is now an emergency vape. lol I like the Fog X vapes, but the Box Frozen Mint, I'll never buy again.",,,

100,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Best for grape lovers,"If you prefer grape flavored menthols, the fox x bar is the best. Super smooth and the flavor stays consistent even after a week. I vape on the heavier side and I can get 2 weeks out of this.",,,
101,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Better than Elfbar,I personally prefer this over the elf bar. The flavor is stronger and I like how these are menthol,,,

104,5.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Green Tea Ice Cream,Best Flavor Ever! Hands down my favorite! It’s got a bitter note at the end bc of the matcha which is nice because I don’t like the sweet flavors. It tastes just like green tea ice cream. And it has a subtle ice feeling after,,,
105,3.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,okay at first..,"flavor runs out after a few days, doesn’t last as long as the elf bar",,,
106,3.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,"Not great hits, little flavor",Taste is meh (iced peaches). It’s tolerable but nothing special. The brand Top Shine is far superior disposable.,,,
107,4.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Tastes great.,It tastes good. Fair amount of menthol. Not my favorite grape flavored vape. Would get again,,,
108,5.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Double the puffs,"Totally worth the money

117,3.0,8 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Burnt,"I like the size and the great air flow. The taste was great for the first couple of days and then it had a burnt taste to it. Personally, I would go back to the stick version.",,,
