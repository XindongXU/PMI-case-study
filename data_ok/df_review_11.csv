88,3.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Decent.,"I like the style and feel of the vape. Didn't really like the flavor I got which was punch bowl or tropical punch, something along those lines. Good air flow and good quality I just didn't like the flavor.",,,

90,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Great,Great!,,,
91,4.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Love the Island Colada and White Gummy,"I've tried two of these little guys so far -- in white gummy, and island colada. I thought the latter could've been a bit stronger in flavor but I thought both were surprisingly delicious and enjoyed the flavors. Even though they have fewer puffs than Elf Bars, these usually last the same amount of time if not slightly longer than those for me. And they're several dollars cheaper, so this is a new go-to brand for me. I'm looking forward to trying the cake pop flavor.",,,
92,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,"Cute, yummy, and long lasting!","Flavors are light, but still noticeable, and not too sweet or dense. I usually like to switch up between strong and light flavors from time to time, so I really like how airy this one is.
USB-C rechargeable is the ultimate plus and charges quick, and this vape definitely lasts longer than it looks.
My favorites are the Grapple Aloe and Strapple Ice if you‚Äôre looking for something fruity, but not too decadent like dessert flavors.
Also a big fan of the Glacial Mint if you want a light pallet cleanser if you‚Äôre already into mint flavors.",,,

126,3.0,8 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Great Flavor Short Life,Like the Candy King this had great flavor but it didn‚Äôt last that long. I got the White Gummi and it tasted soooo goood but again didn‚Äôt last as long as the other vapes I‚Äôve had in the past. I would buy this again just because the flavor was soo good. I was hoping it would last longer than a weekend but then again I went to a music event so who knows how many puffs I actually took.,,,
127,3.0,9 months,5 months to 1 year ago,OG Reds Watermelon Flavor,"This wasn't too bad. I probably won't buy it again though. I really am opposed to rechargeable vapes, but I wanted to try this flavor because I like watermelon. I also think the vape itself had something to do with my review. If it was a slim tall vape like the others, maybe I would've given it 4 stars. Wasn't too fond of the shape of it.",,,
