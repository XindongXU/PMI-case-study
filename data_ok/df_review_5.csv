108,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Best I've used,I like my flavors to skew towards real flavors versus candied flavors and these Lucids are the best so far.

127,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,One of the Ten Best Flavours Currently on the Market,"This actually tastes like chocolate! True, three menthe gives it a chocolate mint sensation. But it's incredibly smooth & pleasantly sweet, but more on the savory side of sweet, more like a dessert than a candy. As far as quality: the phrase on the box hasn't been wrong so far, the flavour has remained strong, refreshing, and chocolate-ey until the (un-re-chageable) battery dies. Which, for me, takes about three weeks (I have several pens going at once). This is one of the ones I can count on to taste good everytime I go to it. Never gets that salty in the back of your mouth taste. Love it!!!",,,

I only wish this were rechargeable. I tried Krispie Treats too, which was not bad but tasted nothing like Rice Krispies, it actually was more... citrusy? Like gummi bears. Very bizarre. These last a good while too, even with me reaching for it constantly.",,,

133,4.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Good quality but mint can be hard,"Their mint flavor can be a lot, especially when you first open it. It almost gives you a brain freeze if you hit it too hard",,,
134,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Aloe grape ice is my go to pick,I have purchased hundreds of vapes ..well I have settled on lucid air aloe grape ice. I've tried every flavor of lucid air if you enjoy a sweet vape this one hits the spot. Flavor lasts till the last draw. I will and do recommend this to all of my vape friends.,,,
135,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Amazing product,"I vape daily in place of cigarettes, I tried several other brands and the flavor would die out after a few days.

140,3.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Honeydew ice,"Wasn‚Äôt a fan of this (very different draw/strength than my go-to elfbar). It‚Äôs really light, and more ice than honeydew. May be a good option for someone who wants a mild flavor.",,,

155,5.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,ICEYYYY,Lucids have been my go to ever since I tried it for the first time. The menthol is perfect. I used to smoke camel silvers and these most definitely provide almost the same amount but at the same time not losing its flavor. Blue raspberry lemonade.. I‚Äôve always bought one every time I go for a haul,,,

324,4.0,1 year,Less than 2 months,Definitely good,The honeydew and aloe grape are my top flavors. The menthol is not too over powering. The only reason I gave them 4/5 stars is because I feel their quality check is lacking a bit. Meaning some times the airflow feels more restricted then the previous same disposable. Or that it stops working even though there is still some juice left (fyi just hit the pen in a different position.. kinda annoying but a easy fix). But even with the issues it is not enough for me to stop buying them consistently.,,,
