23,5.0,6 days,Less than 2 months,My go to flavor,"Luv the Max Flow line! My favorite flavor , I just keep coming back to for couple years now, is strawberry lemonade. I know everyone‚Äôs taste buds and what they‚Äôre looking for in a flavor is extremely varied! that said I am very veryyy sensitive to ‚Äòflavors‚Äô, literally get sick off of one brands flavors and not another‚Äôs. Certain, most, ‚Äòfruit‚Äô flavors don‚Äôt sit well with me, my body thst is, even if the flavor is smooth enough. It has to do with how strong of a facky‚Äô the flavor the flavor is I think.
I‚Äôve yet to hit a banana or apple I can stomach‚Ä¶ my family‚Äôs in the apple growing business lol
Max flow is good on consistency of product control vs many other high hit volume vapes. It‚Äôs about 1 out of 12 that‚Äôs a dud. Others I find 1 out of 5 .
Super happy with my choice!

I enjoyed a few of them but some I enjoyed the flavor so much I felt like I was using them more then I ever smoke. It was like I was doing it for the sweet flavor and not the nicotine need. I have one flavor and one type that has got me off 20 years of smoking. And I hope they keep making them. They are also not as long lasting as others but they are also cheaper. Everyone always talks about ""more hits in this vape"" but the price is always the same variant per hit. I also feel like the more hits the sooner the battery dies or it will dry out before the actual juice is used. Hence why I love these little shirt term ones.",5.0,4.0,3.0

483,5.0,12 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Love huff n puffers,This company is so professional and efficient! They really care about their customers!,,,
484,5.0,12 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Great product!,These are my favorites and unfortunately there are knock offs out there! I‚Äôve ordered from huff and puffers about 4 or 5 times now and I‚Äôve never received a bad Hyppe MAXX flow from them! Their products are real and high quality! : ),,,

493,5.0,1 year,Less than 2 months,Strawberry sky aka strawberry gummy,"So far this is my all-time favorite. This particular brand seems to be the only one I have found that does not leave that nasty aftertaste, make me cough, or cause my chest to hurt. When I first started using the hyppe disposable, I bought them from my local Circle K and they lasted me almost two weeks. I was thrilled to find them for $7 less online from huff and puffers. I ordered from several different places online but this one has the best service and best price overall.
I must admit I probably use it more now that I do not smoke cigarettes at all, but now they only last two days. It's hard for me to imagine that I'm puffing THAT many more puffs then I was before. There are definitely not 2,000 puffs on any setting, because you would literally have to Puff every minute for every waking moment to use it in 2 days time. I use mine on the lowest flow possible and it gives a great hit and very full flavor. I was a pack a day smoker, so it's still cheaper than cigs. They have changed something in these, but they are still, hands down, the best on the market for me.",,,
494,5.0,1 year,Less than 2 months,Cucumber Berry,"This flavor was especially refreshing. This particular brand seems to be the only one I have found that does not leave that nasty aftertaste. My favorite is the strawberry sky or strawberry gummy but this is a nice refreshing change. When I first started using the hyppe disposable, they lasted me almost two weeks. I must admit I probably use it more now, but now they only last two days. It's hard for me to imagine that I'm puffing THAT many more puffs then I was before. Maybe they got a clue and reduced the amount in the vape but how will we ever know?",,,

497,5.0,1 year,Less than 2 months,Went back for some more Naked,"Was afraid they might run out of stock like the other store local to me did, so went back to stock up on some more. Forgot to mention in my previous review that their prices are good. They were lower than the local shop I normally went to and better or competitive with other online only shops.",,,
498,5.0,1 year,Less than 2 months,Naked the smoothest flavor I found so far,"Have had no issues with hits causing me to cough or harshness. Naked is not flavorless. It's mild/medium spearmint flavor ICED. Got brain freeze many times while using it.
So far I used 6-7 units. No defective units and I believe they all lasted about the same amount of time. Currently one unit lasts me about 3-5 days, but I'm still smoking and don't typically use them when I'm home.
Luckily this shop is local to me and I can drive over to purchase what I want. All the people who've helped me so far were nice. It's nice to be able to check their site to see what's in stock before driving over to make a purchase.",,,

711,5.0,2 years,Longer than 1 year,Best disposable yet!,"I absolutely love these and almost every flavor I‚Äôve tried. Of course there are different flavors that will appeal to anyone. I love all of the tropical flavors. The fact that you can control your puff strength is genius. I‚Äôm a previous smoker of almost 15yrs and thought I‚Äôd never be able to quit successfully. These have been life changing. Obviously smoking nothing would be ideal, but I‚Äôm not even close to that yet. I don‚Äôt stink anymore lol, they‚Äôre cheaper than cigarettes now, and taste a hell of a lot better. Personally this brand and type actually resemble the effect of smoking as far as the drag strength and ‚Äúrush‚Äù go, although I am smoking way less than I ever smoked cigs. These are hands down the best disposable I‚Äôve tried, I will continue to buy these! Not to mention the shipping is super quick, so definite added bonus :)",,,
