73,5.0,4 months,3 months to 5 months ago,Still a favorite,"We keep coming back to the Top Shine Cherub even after trying others. The flavor is rich and smooth, without having a chemical or metallic after-taste.

99,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Surprisingly good,"I'm reluctant to try new brands these days as I've gotten so many duds that way. I passed over this brand for some time but I'm pleasantly surprised by Top Shine. I purchased the Lychee flavored vape and I will definitely try it again. This vape has a smooth texture, very bold flavor, even for lychee which is often subtle. It tastes juicy and more like the real fruit, not artificial or candy like, and no after taste. No real complaints here.",,,

106,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Flavorful,"This is my girlfriend's favorite brand and I can see why. The flavors are rich and are not as basic as the other disposables. You can tell the company invests a lot of research into getting the flavors right. There hasn't been a flavor that I didn't like! They last long and are rechargeable with USB-C. They die an awful death though, meaning the burnt flavor comes out of nowhere when they are about to die. Will probably order more once we are done trying everything else :)",,,
