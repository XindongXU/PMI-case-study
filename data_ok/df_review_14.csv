Since weening off cigarettes and whiting to vapes, I don‚Äôt want to be reminded of menthol / tobacco flavors anymore. I‚Äôve noticed with almost all disposables, they have a minty flavor. These do not. I‚Äôm in love. I‚Äôll be purchasing other flavors soon. Honeydew Ice and lychee berry are my faves so far.",5.0,5.0,5.0

120,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Swft Mod Cool Mint,Smooth and refreshing minty hit,,,
121,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,So cute and colorful,These disposables are so perfect in size and so colorful. I love how they look and I got 4 of them to see how they all taste and I think the grape ice is the best so far. I also love how this company doesn‚Äôt use random shipping couriers like all the other vape stores do. I got my package in a weeks time so that beats the month time frame from all the other vape stores!,,,
122,4.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Good value,The flavors are great. Seems to last quite a long time and they are reasonably priced on this site. Would have given 5 stars but swft needs to improve QC every so often you get a defective unit. Huff and Puffers has great customer service and is awesome about taking care of any problems promptly.,,,
123,4.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Best flavors but die quickly,"MY FAVE!!! Pods and elf bars are way too sweet for me so when I tried this brand all the flavors so far have been great. If you‚Äôre looking for something not too sweet then this is the brand for you. The only downside is after a week the flavor dies down and it tastes like sugar vapor, like no flavor just a sweet inhale. So that gets so annoying. My go to is the pink lemonade and honey dew. Pineapple punch is good also. I just picked up gummy bear and it‚Äôs ok. I can‚Äôt really pinpoint what it reminds me of but it‚Äôs probably my least fave so far.",,,

139,4.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Decent,"I've only tried the pineapple one. The flavor was mediocre. Didn't really stand out among the other ones. I personally like the design, but I wouldn't get out of my way to look for these. If they were the only ones a vape shop had, I wouldn't mind buying it though.

146,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,One of the best disposables I‚Äôve had,This is one of the best disposables I‚Äôve tried. Flavors are there and the best part is that it‚Äôs rechargeable. One of my previous fave was the lucid air but it wasn‚Äôt rechargeable so it was a waste. I went to a vape shop and was recommended this one and now it‚Äôs my fave! Highly recommended!,,,

154,5.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Another great vape from SWFT,"Tried out the Strawberry Lush Ice flavor this time and so far it's pretty good! I think I still like the Lush Ice better, but this one is nice as well. Can't wait to try out other flavors from SWFT.",,,
155,5.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,One of my favorite vapes,"I've really been enjoying the SWFT Mods so far! They hit pretty hard and they're nicely mentholated. Also last a surprisingly long time! This is my first time trying them and I really like the Lush Ice flavor so far. The only downside is they require a microUSB cord to charge so I had to dig one out of storage, but otherwise a great vape!",,,
