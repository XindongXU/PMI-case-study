2,5.0,26 days,Less than 2 months,Super clean hits/draws/drags,"For top of the line taste that's more full-bodied and not overly confectionary, this brand keeps it clean, with the verified check, and plenty of puffs per cartridge. I did have one, though, that turned super dank after the first full de-charge - Got'ta know when the good stuff gets bad, whether bad taste, or bad sting or feel, or whatever else. Otherwise, though Hyde is great.",5.0,5.0,5.0

21,4.0,3 months,3 months to 5 months ago,"Great device, some great flavors","Only reason i would go with 4 stars is the killa confetti and bomb berry pop ice flavors were really not enjoyable for me. I do tend to be very picky with anything other than mint so take that for what uou will. But the mint jewel ice and blue razz peach bears ice flavors are really great. Similar experience to elf bar (not flavors, just experience) except it has a 3 way airflow switch which is really nice.",3.0,5.0,5.0

49,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Better than most!,"I like to reuse my disposable rechargeable vapes. I hate the idea of throwing them out. With a little work, the bottom can be pulled out and the fiber filling refills easily. The OTHER brands have a bad programming that after X amount of puffs, they won't fire correctly anymore. Not these! Going strong and letting me refill over and over again!",,,
