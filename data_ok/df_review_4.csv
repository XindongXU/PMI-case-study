31,5.0,6 days,Less than 2 months,Love the Pebble VS the Gio,"Would religiously vape on the Flum Gio. You are supposed to get 3,000 hits out of the Gio, but it always seemed like less. I also had multiple occasions where it would die after a day or two when it should have been lasting an average of 5-7 days. Then I found the Pebble which gave you an average of double the hits for $1.00 more. Instead of stocking up 5 vapes for an average of 2 to 3 weeks, I can buy 7 for $1.00 more for 1.5 to 2 months. Definitely a no brainer!",5.0,1.0,5.0

These are the reason that I barely smoke cigarettes, but also the reason that I‚Äôm vaping way more (not sure which is better?) The worst part about the pebbles is that my friends try to steal them! They are definitely on the sweeter side (sweeter than the skinny flums), but it ultimately depends on the flavor.
Favorite flavors are Mango Icy, White Gummy and Aloe Grape but don‚Äôt hate any of the flavors I‚Äôve tried. Least favs are probably Cherry & Apple. Honestly just stick to your normal preference of flavor profile, knowing it will be a little bit sweeter, and these flums will do you no wrong.",5.0,4.0,5.0
