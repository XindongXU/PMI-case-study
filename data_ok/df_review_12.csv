Yes, you heard that right, these bad boys are rechargeable and boy does it do the trick. 7000 puffs, rechargeable, and flavor is good til the battery dies. I‚Äôve had my go to flavor, pineapple peach whip, for over a month! Still going strong. Also a big fan of the lychee aloe, great lychee flavor profile and not super overpowering due to the aloe.",5.0,4.0,5.0

178,2.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Not worth the price,I thought I would try these newer style vapes. They've got nothing on the short fat ones. Not smooth and the flavors aren't great.,,,

182,3.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Peach Whip,"Peach whip was an ok flavor - as state din other reviews, I wish they had the same flavors offered in smaller versions. Shipped fast - H&P is the best",,,
183,5.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Impressive,"I've tried the regular daze egge, but I tried this one on a whim in tropical gummy. I don't try a lot of new flavors these days because they're usually a miss, but this was delicious. It didn't quite last for 7000 puffs before it burned, but it did last a good month with light to medium usage and I didnt feel like the flavor started to die like with other brands. I'm impressed enough to try this one again. Great quality for the price.",,,

189,1.0,5 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Womp Womp,"I‚Äôm not sure if it was that insane heat wave we had a few ago or what but when I received my order by mail and opened one of these, every time I took a puff, it kept on burning. I hadn‚Äôt noticed at first because I was in a noisy area but when I realized what was happening, that thing burned out within a few hours. I had ordered 4 at the time so I opened up a different one hoping that it was just that one, it wasn‚Äôt. It did the same thing so I ended up sending them all back. I did like the flavor and the way it hit but my experience wasn‚Äôt a good one.",,,

Only downside, my specific one had a lot of spit back, didn‚Äôt bother me too much but it may bother some folks. Could‚Äôve just been mine or maybe I had it upside down in my pocket for sometime and didn‚Äôt realize",,,

201,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Last forever,"I really like the daze vape juice so I decided to try this. Let me tell you that this disposable doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It has great flavor and it‚Äôs rechargeable. It took me a min to get used to big salt, but now I love it.",,,
202,4.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Great flavors!,These have great flavors. Gave only one star less than 5 because the draw action is kinda weird sometimes. Aside from that I have no complaints.,,,

206,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,The best,longest and best yet,,,
207,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Long Lasting,"I purchased several Daze Ohmlet devices because they claim to last up to 7000 puffs. Of course, I haven't tested the accuracy of this claim, but they certainly last longer than any other disposable vapes I've tried. The flavors are decent as well. Not too bland, not too many different flavors packed into one, but just the right amount of basic sweetness. They are rechargeable with USB-C to make them even longer lasting. Would recommend this to anyone who find their disposables run out too fast.",,,
208,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,üëçüëç,Love it,,,
209,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Yes,"Plain and simple. Tastes as the name implies. Long lasting. Just needs to be charged more often in between. Other than that, no complaints.",,,

211,5.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Lasts a long time,I bought this two weeks ago and it‚Äôs still going strong. I hit my pen a lot through out the day and it has lasted forever. I wish it had more flavor variety.,,,
212,4.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Not my favorite,"If I had to compare this towards the first Daze Egge, I'd choose the egge over this",,,

Tropical gummy is pretty sweet, the blueberry peach is a lil icy for me but I'm a no ice kind of guy so I have low standards, the peach pineapple whip is to die for sweet and icy.",,,

240,3.0,6 months,5 months to 1 year ago,Just ok,Not a huge fan. Coming from the Elf Bar; the flavor is not as strong and the draw is sub-par on these. Great for a backup but definitely will be going back to the Elf Bar.,,,
241,5.0,7 months,5 months to 1 year ago,My favorite rechargeable,"Loving the Daze rechargeables! Super long lasting and great flavors. I got the Pineapple Peach Whip and Icy Blast. I'm not big on fruity flavors but it had me wanting to try more. I usually stick to mint/menthol flavors, and Icy Blast is definitely in my personally top 3. A perfect balance of ice and sweet.",,,
